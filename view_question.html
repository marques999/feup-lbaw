			<blockquote class="medium fw-300">I am asked this question a lot. People are disillusioned and frustrated with the “safe” advice from financial professionals, family, and friends to “Save and invest throughout your lifetime.”</blockquote>
			<p class="medium">Licensed Financial Service providers are required by law to provide this answer to the public because the public is not a “qualified investor.” According to <b><i>the Securities Act of 1933 </i></b>and defined in <b><i>Regulation D</i></b>, <i>accredited/qualified investors are classified as meeting certain criteria, such as having an annual income of at least $200,000 in each of the past two years ($300,000 for joint income) or a net worth of at least $1 million</i>. I know because I was a licensed financial services provider. I was required to give up my licenses in order to share with, and teach people the needed mindset, knowledge, and skills that I now share some of with you. </p>

			<p class="medium">Society is not provided with the knowledge needed to achieve the real security, freedom and independence that only comes with wealth. Truth be told, most people have a warped misconception of what wealth is, and are unwilling to do what is required in order to become truly wealthy. Real wealth is power, the power to do what you want, when you want without worrying about the necessities of life. Real wealth is in having the power to control your life, and decide what it is you want to do, with the ability to do it. If you are serious about becoming wealthy, you must first decide to do what most are unwilling to do, and take control and responsibility of your life.</p>
			<p class="medium">Financial Services professionals, family, friends, the education system, and churches will not tell you that your life is a business. That Your Life, is Your Business, and must be treated as a business in order to become wealthy. You will find that there are a number of wealthy entrepreneurs, and authors who share this mindset. An excellent book on the subject is “The Start-up of You” by Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha available on Amazon. You can also Google “life is a business” and you will find plenty of material on this subject form successful like minded writers.</p>

			<p class="medium">Once you accept that your life is a business and decide to manage your life as if you would a business, your next step is to build your coaching and mentoring team. This is critical to achieving your life goals, as well as achieving real security and freedom. For example, housing is an essential element to personal security. Yet most individuals and families are dependent upon their income to secure their housing. This course of action takes up 30-40% of income in either rent or mortgage payments. Perceived savings built in equity from a mortgage comes at the cost of interest paid over the lifetime of the mortgage. In addition, whether renting or owning property taxes must also be paid annually. Yes, renters pay the property tax on the home they are renting. However, it is an unrealized expense as the owner has it calculated and included in the monthly rents. </p>
			<p class="medium">What most young 20 something do not know is that they can buy a 4-plex just as easy as a SFR (Single Family Residence). The difference is that if done correctly the rent from 3 of the 4 units will pay all expenses, i.e. mortgage, insurance, property taxes, maintenance, etc.. In addition, it will also add a small profit to monthly cash flow and allow you to keep the 30-40% of your earned income that would be going to pay the rent or mortgage in your pocket. The difference this makes may not seem significant, however it becomes painfully apparent during a recession/depression when people are losing their jobs, their source of income. Individuals who’s housing is dependent upon their earned income are among the first to lose their housing if they don’t find employment quickly. Whereas individuals who’s housing is based on their rental income, are a lot more secure having the security of rental income to pay the housing bills and keep food on the table.</p>
			<p class="medium">Knowing how to manage your life/business and make strategies and investment choices that increase one’s net worth, income, wealth, security, and freedom requires the right mindset, coaches, and mentors to achieve this reality. I know because that was what I had to do to move forward and become wealthy and truly free. It also gives me the freedom to mentor and coach young entrepreneurs and help them develop both themselves, and their business. However, I can only do this with individuals who are dedicated to learning how to achieve their objectives and goals. This is true in every teaching &amp; learning situation, a mentor, coach, teacher, can only teach so long as the student is willing to learn. If you are not willing to learn than no one will be able to help you. Mentors, coaches, teachers, etc. will never be able to make you wealthy or poor. Only you can do that. What mentors, coaches, teachers, etc. can do is point you in the right direction and help you develop the skillsets needed to achieve your desired objective and goal. So choose your mentors, coaches, and advisors wisely and carefully.</p>
